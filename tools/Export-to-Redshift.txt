How to Export Usergrid Data to Redshift
=======================================

When getting analytics of who and how your usergrid cluster is being used, 
SQL is sometimes better than NoSQL. The Redshift export tool lets you export 
your collections into a SQL datawarehouse to build any metrics of your desire. 
You can compute how many people are using Usergrid, How many Applications have 
been created, top users of your cluster, and a whole lot more

Prerequisites
-------------

Setup a computer with the following software

   Java 7
   Python 2.7
   The Python psychopg2 module

Unpack Tools Release
--------------------

Unpack the Usergrid-Tools release in /usr/share
You will see the following directory structure:

   /usr/share/usergrid_tools/
      README.txt 
      bin
         usergrid-tools.jar
         usergrid-export.sh
      conf
         usergrid-custom.properties

Edit Configuration
------------------

Edit the usergrid-custom.properties file and set all properties indicated by 
the comments.

Setup Cron Job
--------------

Create a cron job that calls usergrid-export.sh every four hours.

Once that is done, data will be exported from Usegrid, uploaded to S3 and then 
added to Redshift.
